5.6.0,4,App works only when device is not taking a reading therefore you need to turn the meter on by itself. Should be able to sync when you just take a reading or stay on to sync right after you pull the test strip out rather than shutting off immediately.

5.6.0,2,I appreciate what this app does a little. The logging of the info isn't what's important. Calculating the insulin to take and logging the amount of insulin taken would be a lot more helpful so the glucometer should have that functionality available as well as this app. Though I will admit the tracking and features available in this app are many they just seem to be lacking some very important pieces! Check out the t1d1 app for the functionality I mentioned. Edit: 2 stars because of response tyvm,0,0.3803571428571429,0.6142857142857142,Positive,meter
