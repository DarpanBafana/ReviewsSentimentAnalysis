5.5.0,2,"Disappointing. I had no trouble installing, configuring, or pairing with my new Reflect meter. Until I started actually doing blood tests. They didn't show up in the app. Nada. And no clear evidence whether the app is actually communicating with the meter at that time (if I change range settings, the app asks me whether to use the meter setting or app setting, but doesn't say when it got the meter setting). So I entered the data manually. Then I realized that I can only set ""before meal."" I test twice a day: before breakfast (""fasting"" - 80-120) and before dinner (ummm ... ""behaving""? - 80-130). I don't want ""good"" tags if I'm out of range, I don't want ""bad"" tags if I'm in range. I did another test this morning, and instead of entering the reading manually, I started playing with the phone's bluetooth settings, which show the meter is not connected. I clicked ""+"" to tell the phone to connect to the meter - it didn't. I disconnected the phone from my fitness band - still didn't. I poked around some more. I looked at the meter. It showed the most recent test result, acquired via bluetooth from the meter. Sigh. So I don't know if I just haven't been waiting long enough, if I need to disconnect my fitness band, or if I need to randomly fool with bluetooth settings. But once I get that working, I still will have the most basic problem that the app won't accurately tell me whether or not I am in my target ranges half the time. So far it seems like all I've gained by upgrading from a OneTouch Ultra is smaller blood drops. Oh - and the meter setting time from the app beats the heck out of the Ultras, where I refused to adjust for daylight savings or correct for time drift because setting the time was such a hassle. (Anyone else remember connecting by serial cable and getting a message that the meter time and computer time didn't agree and you needed to manually reset the time? Sheesh louise - why couldn't they just ask if they should correct the meter to match the computer?) What it all the fancy and elegant super-features of meter and app don't amount to a hill of beans if the app and meter won't: consistently tell me if I am in range. If I need to disconnect the fitness band or fiddle with bluetooth settings every time I want to sync, I'll only be syncing once a week, if that.

The app forces use of an online account which is not in keeping with Privacy Law, there should be ability to opt-out of cloud storage.

Finally I uninstalled /reinstalled the app. I was fearful that my readings would all disappear but they were still there. I just couldn't sync. The problem turned out to be that It kept timing out during the sync because I hadn't synced for a few weeks so there was a lot of data to transfer The solution was to keep pressing the up/down arrows to keep the meter from going into sleep mode. So it works now and I find the information useful for tracking my blood sugar. I'm guessing that this was caused by waiting too long between syncs which caused the meter to time out. Unfortunately there are no error codes telling you what to do. It just says 'Failed to sync' which leaves you trying to sort out the problem.",1,-0.16875,0.5375,Negative

3.4,1,UPDATE:  3-29-2018 first of all a recent app update solved all of the problems I reported earlier. It works great! Also just upgraded to Galaxy S9 and had some problems where the app crashed every time I launched it. Customer Service was extremely helpful and resolved the problem. It has to do with a discovered problem that involves the fingerprint security feature. Great app! Highly recommend for anyone who wants to monitor their blood glucose level and enter carbohydrate and insulin data.   The Android app synced with the meter about 80% of the time before the 6-9-2017 upgrade. Now it syncs maybe 5%... if I'm lucky. Extremely frustrating and annoying. What's the point of the Bluetooth feature of our doesn't work?! Please provide instructions to work around our new upgrade to resolve syncing problem between Android app and Verio Flex.

For example, why slap a giant image in the way of data entry or put the insulin and carb entry buttons behind the keyboard so you have to scroll all the time? And the kind of reports and graphs they provide are not the ones diabetics and doctors actually use. For example, it can't tell you how much insulin you used last quarter or even report glucose measurements for the quarter.

3.4,3,"The app itself, seems to work OK for me, but I just started using it a couple of days ago. We will see what happens soon.   A note to LifeScan Europe:   I have read many complaints about your setup screens and the date function, to which you replied: ""We use Android's native date picker, which requires you to select the year first by tapping on the year and scrolling to the correct year before selecting the month and day"".   This is not possible. This is not a standard Android date GUI. Yours requires you to scroll through the months backwards to your birthdate. I tried several times to tap anywhere on that screen, and it simply does not respond at all to tap input. Actually, the entire setup process does not respond to tap input. Even the name entry. You tap on ""First Name"" and enter your name. You tap on ""Last Name"" and nothing happens. You can't select a different text box.  Your only option is to get the order of operations correct and keep hitting the ""Next"" button, but the order of operations is messed up; you have to START the process by tapping the ""I Agree"" box at the bottom BEFORE going to the ""First Name"" entry and only THEN can you continue on with hitting the ""Next"" button!  If you screw up ANYWHERE in the process, your only option is to abort the entire process and start over from the very beginning (I felt like I was learning a new video game just to register!). Ultimately, it took between 7 and 9 attempts (from the beginning each time), totalling over 40 minutes, to finally get it registered.  I am a very heavy user of touch-devices, and have registered literally thousands of applications over the years, and I have never seen one that took this long to enter name, birthdate and country of use before, ever.   Had this been an app for any purpose other than my health care management, I would have ditched the app after the second or third attempt at registration. Please standardize your setup screen, and please use more Beta testers on various platforms BEFORE releasing/forcing updates to the general users.  Thank you for your time.

For example parents who stay in two different households. BEFORE YOU ALL DO ANYTHING EXTRA PLEASE FIX SYNCING ISSUE.

3.2,1,"App only allows entering insulin doses, no option to enter other medications being taken for my diabetes other than the ""notes"" field. Overall meter is easy to use but bulky compared to other brands with the same features (or even more features). So after two days of using this app and the OneTouch Verio Flex meter the app stopped syncing. Being that I'm an IT guy, I did all the troubleshooting steps (uninstalled/reinstalled app, impaired device, rebooted phone, etc.) Without any luck. Now this garbage app will not pair to my device. Support rep had me do all the troubleshooting steps all over again without any luck. I asked how to impaired the device from within the app and was told that can only be done via the website so as I told the rep I would like to try that she gave be the standard goodbye statement and hung up on me. Upon calling back, after verifying all my info the rep TD me they do not support the app running on Android 7 at this time. OneToich - take your garbage app and meter and .......  Switched over to this app/meter after five months of waiting for a version that works. So far, app is ok. Every few days I have to place my phone in airplane mode to reset the Bluetooth radio or it won't sync with the meter. Would be nice if I could easily record all medications I take within this app but I use Medisafe for that (wish there was a way for Medisafe to interact with OneTouch to get my readings but I doubt that would happen).",5,0.12447916666666665,0.5010416666666667,Negative

I performed a factory reset and reinstalled the OnetTouch Reveal app two days ago. When syncing with the meter, the app did not pickup all of the readings from the meter. This was not the first time that I've experienced this. My Note 7 did the same thing, along with my previous S7 edge. I can usually delete the data and re-sync the meter. It may take several cycles of deleting and syncing, to get everything. I just now did that. I had 40 readings for the last 14 days. While I was working on this review, the app starting syncing. When it was done, I had 11 readings for the past 14 days. The data is still in the meter. However, the app is malfunctioning.",2,0.13194444444444445,0.34097222222222223,Negative

2.1.3,4,The Bluetooth updating is GREAT. As soon as I turn the app my meter sinks up and I can add the info about  meals and insulin dosses.

The ability to delete a reading :  I know that sounds odd...but I had a mis-read just yesterday (must have had something sweet on my finger) where it read 29.9...used a different finger right after that and it read 11.0. That 29 is throwing off my averages not and I would like to be able to remove it. There are times too when I test friequently when i have a high reading and I take some insulin to being it down...I don't need to have all the highs listed in the app. (I know it could be used to doctor the results but you are only cheating yourself if you do that...and the A1C test will show the truth then taken.)  2.) It would be nice to have a pie chart option as apposed to just a graph.that way you can see at a quick glance the majority of readings before and after meals. if they are majority high or in target...the pie chart shows that very quickly and easy to read.,9,0.285936507936508,0.586047619047619,Positive
