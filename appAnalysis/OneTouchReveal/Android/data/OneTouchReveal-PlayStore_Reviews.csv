I had no trouble installing, configuring, or pairing with my new Reflect meter. Until I started actually doing blood tests. They didn't show up in the app. Nada. And no clear evidence whether the app is actually communicating with the meter at that time (if I change range settings, the app asks me whether to use the meter setting or app setting, but doesn't say when it got the meter setting). So I entered the data manually. Then I realized that I can only set ""before meal."" I test twice a day: before breakfast (""fasting"" - 80-120) and before dinner (ummm ... ""behaving""? - 80-130). I don't want ""good"" tags if I'm out of range, I don't want ""bad"" tags if I'm in range. I did another test this morning, and instead of entering the reading manually, I started playing with the phone's bluetooth settings, which show the meter is not connected. I clicked ""+"" to tell the phone to connect to the meter - it didn't. I disconnected the phone from my fitness band - still didn't. I poked around some more. I looked at the meter. It showed the most recent test result, acquired via bluetooth from the meter. Sigh. So I don't know if I just haven't been waiting long enough, if I need to disconnect my fitness band, or if I need to randomly fool with bluetooth settings. But once I get that working, I still will have the most basic problem that the app won't accurately tell me whether or not I am in my target ranges half the time. So far it seems like all I've gained by upgrading from a OneTouch Ultra is smaller blood drops. Oh - and the meter setting time from the app beats the heck out of the Ultras, where I refused to adjust for daylight savings or correct for time drift because setting the time was such a hassle. (Anyone else remember connecting by serial cable and getting a message that the meter time and computer time didn't agree and you needed to manually reset the time? Sheesh louise - why couldn't they just ask if they should correct the meter to match the computer?) What it all the fancy and elegant super-features of meter and app don't amount to a hill of beans if the app and meter won't: consistently tell me if I am in range. If I need to disconnect the fitness band or fiddle with bluetooth settings every time I want to sync, I'll only be syncing once a week, if that.

The app forces use of an online account which is not in keeping with Privacy Law, there should be ability to opt-out of cloud storage. Why do they need my info and my readings, this does not improve my situation, and it should be my choice. The bluetooth is neither direct nor intuitive. I had to unpair and re-pair consistently as the device looses connection and does not re-establish properly. They say it is simple but after you read reviews you will find that simple is in the eye of the uses. The customer service is less than stellar, they do not understand bluetooth and just keep saying pair your device. If you try to use the app when not connected to the internet it sits there trying to sync to the internet for no reason, cannot sync move on. Syncing with bluetooth takes an extremely long time, not sure why the app syncs for 20-30 seconds for 1 entry. The app does not let you change eating times or personal behavior to adjust to your needs, remember breakfast is only in the morning, not at noon if you are a late person, etc. This app and system needs a lot of work and understanding of how humans actually work.

Meter works with several features beyond the intuitive introduction practices. Adding meal comments is very inconsistant in opening as well as saving afterward way too often unresponsive. downgraded because sync is nearly non functional. no pattern to how to make it sync; after many different tries of sequences it does finally happen. i don't know how well other meters work but this one is surely a lemon. #junk,1,3,4.3.1,2019-07-21 22:43:14,"Thank you for your review!

The past two updates have made Bluetooth a thing of the past. Might work for one test a week. User authentication? That feature is a worthless pain in the ass. You lost 4 stars for poor updates. There are better app solutions if I have to enter tests manually. The Bluetooth is broken in this app. A manual sync button to start it would be better.

I like setting ranges. But I don't like forced meal and sleep times; then it resets the whole app retroactively if changed. Bottom line: app needs more manual input ability.

Update as of Monday October 15th it's been several weeks maybe a couple of months but this app disappeared off of Google Play for a while and now it's back but it will not sync up with my phone anymore so I cannot keep track of my blood sugar I called the company who said they would check into it and get back to me but they never did so I guess they really don't care about their product I have a recording of the phone call and I'll be calling the back tomorrow because this is really pissing me off as of right now OneTouch is no good,1,0,3.6,2018-10-16 04:44:36,,

Everything is supposed to be done in the background. I have to scan for the device by searching for a new Bluetooth device each time.

Was ok when first started using. Has since stopped syncing with Walgreens (as of May 2018) and no longer able to earn my Walgreens points with the App for doing readings. Sad that with each new update more problems cause less functionality with the App. Likely will be just dumping it after the next update as it probably won't work at all then and I'll just go back to my other Verio meter that is rechargable and has a light on the display which is much easier to read and a far superior meter than the Verio Flex that is so limited and you have to battle the App to get it to even sync up to the meter.,2,0,3.5,2018-08-17 20:42:03,,

The problem turned out to be that It kept timing out during the sync because I hadn't synced for a few weeks so there was a lot of data to transfer The solution was to keep pressing the up/down arrows to keep the meter from going into sleep mode. So it works now and I find the information useful for tracking my blood sugar. I'm guessing that this was caused by waiting too long between syncs which caused the meter to time out.

That shouldn't happen it isn't seeing when I manually have to add something and it doesn't appear to be able to add BG levels on the PC version why is that? Could you please fix and make the app more user friendly.   Well, it isn't syncing again after I spent the pairing, and unpairing to get it to work at the end of the daym back to not working. Up until a few days ago it worked, what on earth did you do to it?  Please fix!!!",1,36,3.5,2018-06-12 04:41:57,,

UPDATE: I do wish comments on BS were easier to figure out and were visible on the table summary view.",4,2,3.4,2018-04-09 11:33:17,,

It works great! Also just upgraded to Galaxy S9 and had some problems where the app crashed every time I launched it. Customer Service was extremely helpful and resolved the problem. It has to do with a discovered problem that involves the fingerprint security feature. Great app! Highly recommend for anyone who wants to monitor their blood glucose level and enter carbohydrate and insulin data.   The Android app synced with the meter about 80% of the time before the 6-9-2017 upgrade. Now it syncs maybe 5%... if I'm lucky. Extremely frustrating and annoying. What's the point of the Bluetooth feature of our doesn't work?! Please provide instructions to work around our new upgrade to resolve syncing problem between Android app and Verio Flex.

Its like they never talked to real diabetics. If you are devoted to tight tracking it may not be worth the hassle of the bad ux just to get your glucose measurement entered automatically.  For example, why slap a giant image in the way of data entry or put the insulin and carb entry buttons behind the keyboard so you have to scroll all the time? And the kind of reports and graphs they provide are not the ones diabetics and doctors actually use. For example, it can't tell you how much insulin you used last quarter or even report glucose measurements for the quarter.

We will see what happens soon.   A note to LifeScan Europe:   I have read many complaints about your setup screens and the date function, to which you replied: ""We use Android's native date picker, which requires you to select the year first by tapping on the year and scrolling to the correct year before selecting the month and day"".   This is not possible. This is not a standard Android date GUI. Yours requires you to scroll through the months backwards to your birthdate. I tried several times to tap anywhere on that screen, and it simply does not respond at all to tap input. Actually, the entire setup process does not respond to tap input. Even the name entry. You tap on ""First Name"" and enter your name. You tap on ""Last Name"" and nothing happens. You can't select a different text box.  Your only option is to get the order of operations correct and keep hitting the ""Next"" button, but the order of operations is messed up; you have to START the process by tapping the ""I Agree"" box at the bottom BEFORE going to the ""First Name"" entry and only THEN can you continue on with hitting the ""Next"" button!  If you screw up ANYWHERE in the process, your only option is to abort the entire process and start over from the very beginning (I felt like I was learning a new video game just to register!). Ultimately, it took between 7 and 9 attempts (from the beginning each time), totalling over 40 minutes, to finally get it registered.  I am a very heavy user of touch-devices, and have registered literally thousands of applications over the years, and I have never seen one that took this long to enter name, birthdate and country of use before, ever.   Had this been an app for any purpose other than my health care management, I would have ditched the app after the second or third attempt at registration. Please standardize your setup screen, and please use more Beta testers on various platforms BEFORE releasing/forcing updates to the general users.  Thank you for your time.

Never had a problem syncing until this last update in December 2017 whatever you guys did please correct it as soon as possible. Thank you! Also if you guys could add an extra feature for multiple family members to view the blood sugar log when logged in from diffent device would be awesome for people with family members who help them manage their blood sugar numbers. For example parents who stay in two different households. BEFORE YOU ALL DO ANYTHING EXTRA PLEASE FIX SYNCING ISSUE. I will give 4 stars after meter syncing issue is fix and 5 stars if meter sync issue is fix and extra feature of multiple family members can view blood sugar logs from multiple devices in different location from meter is added.,2,3,3.3,2018-01-26 16:51:56,,

Overall meter is easy to use but bulky compared to other brands with the same features (or even more features). So after two days of using this app and the OneTouch Verio Flex meter the app stopped syncing. Being that I'm an IT guy, I did all the troubleshooting steps (uninstalled/reinstalled app, impaired device, rebooted phone, etc.) Without any luck. Now this garbage app will not pair to my device. Support rep had me do all the troubleshooting steps all over again without any luck. I asked how to impaired the device from within the app and was told that can only be done via the website so as I told the rep I would like to try that she gave be the standard goodbye statement and hung up on me. Upon calling back, after verifying all my info the rep TD me they do not support the app running on Android 7 at this time. OneToich - take your garbage app and meter and .......  Switched over to this app/meter after five months of waiting for a version that works. So far, app is ok. Every few days I have to place my phone in airplane mode to reset the Bluetooth radio or it won't sync with the meter. Would be nice if I could easily record all medications I take within this app but I use Medisafe for that (wish there was a way for Medisafe to interact with OneTouch to get my readings but I doubt that would happen).",1,5,3.2,2017-10-23 16:36:49,,

Instead of just being able to log ""carbs"" would like to be able to log meals & snacks. As is, it's great if you count carbs but some of us don't. Logging meal times would be handy in tracking blood sugars in relation to meal times. Also the charting & reports are limited. This isn't the most versatile logbook app I've used but the fact that it syncs with my meter makes up for it. I would recommend this app and meter to a friend with a few qualifications. Update: Have been using app now for a while and the sync has been great, no issues. The reports/trending are still limited. Have found it best to export to csv to look at trends. Would also offer one more suggestion to the developers to provide further flexibility in adjusting times for daily routines. I work rotating shifts so sometimes my schedule is flipped where I am going to bed in the morning and eating my main meal at midnight.

When syncing with the meter, the app did not pickup all of the readings from the meter. This was not the first time that I've experienced this. My Note 7 did the same thing, along with my previous S7 edge. I can usually delete the data and re-sync the meter. It may take several cycles of deleting and syncing, to get everything. I just now did that. I had 40 readings for the last 14 days. While I was working on this review, the app starting syncing. When it was done, I had 11 readings for the past 14 days.

That 29 is throwing off my averages not and I would like to be able to remove it. There are times too when I test friequently when i have a high reading and I take some insulin to being it down...I don't need to have all the highs listed in the app. (I know it could be used to doctor the results but you are only cheating yourself if you do that...and the A1C test will show the truth then taken.)  2.) It would be nice to have a pie chart option as apposed to just a graph.that way you can see at a quick glance the majority of readings before and after meals. if they are majority high or in target...the pie chart shows that very quickly and easy to read.,4,9,2.1.3,2016-06-24 20:21:19,,
