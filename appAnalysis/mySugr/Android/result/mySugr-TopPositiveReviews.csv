2.0.1,5,"I'm using this to log my 7 y/o son's BG. This app makes it fast and easy to do, it's actually kinda fun too. I specifically needed the ability to export a PDF file to his diabetes team because I don't have a computer anymore to download his meter and pump. It would be nice to be able to program more than one target range, my son has different target ranges for day and night.  It would also be nice to have tags for the location so we don't always have to type it. A+ app though, my first time writing a review",0,0.3383333333333333,0.5791666666666666,Positive,use

2.0.1,4,"Ive tried a lot of Glucose tracking apps.  This one is the most complete.  Obviously designed by someone familiar with ""the club"".  The only thing I would really like to see is a food/nutrition database.  I am new to DB and do not yet have a handle on how many carbs everything is.  I use MyfitnessPal now to track food consumption.  It is perfect for inputting meals and spitting out how many carbs, sodium, fiber, protein I am getting per meal/day/week.  But; it cannot track heath issues like glucose.  So I am using both this app to track Sugar and MyFitnessPal to track food.   If MySugr could add a food database similar to how myfitnesspal does it; you would have a near perfect app!",1,0.33933566433566437,0.5657342657342658,Positive,track
