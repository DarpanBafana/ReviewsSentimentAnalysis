3.81.1,3,"I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is ""Duh?"" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, ""Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y."" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it.

3.78.0,3,"Don't get me wrong, I like the basics, but I'm a long way away from my PCP (300+ Miles) and it is important for me to have the a1c estimate function available, but like Gene Willacker's comments, this function is lost when you don't use a minimum of 3 strips a day. I'm sure the developer will claim that the frequent tests are needed to do the a1c estimate. However, the popup says that you need to take your BC at least 3 times a day, but if you skip a day or so, it is okay. Well, that doesn't appear to be true, as overnight, I will lose the a1c function. This app is indeed appearing to be something to encourage the use of test strips, which are very expensive and not always covered by medical insurance. I must admit that I feel like so many companies play on diabetes sufferers by encouraging unrealistic BC / A1c levels.

3.73.1,1,"This app appears to be quite useful for recording information related to diabetes management. However, the reporting function has some serious shortcomings with regard to accuracy and how the stored data is reported. Despite having alerted the developer to this, the response has merely been to tell the user that the app is being used incorrectly. This is very unfortunate since, despite having gone to great lengths to provide very specific and clear information highlighting the error, the developers have failed to take the matter seriously and have merely blamed my blood sugar meter. This is in fact quite bizarre since my blood sugar meter does not connect with this app and all the data input has been manual and can clearly be checked when using the ""export to Excel"" function within the app. There are some other issues with the report where it doesn't always adopt the units specified during setup of the app so some elements of the reported data aren't much use unless the user wishes to convert them outside the app. Support from the developer has been a little hit and miss in terms of response to emails. However, the communication style is extremely casual and more appropriate to chatting with friends on social media than it is responding to customer concerns about defects within the app. Perhaps herein lies the root of the problem with the shortcomings of the app and the lack of maturity of approach to its development has lead to some unfortunate issues. It is a shame because the app has the potential to be better than any other used to date.",57,-0.03283333333333333,0.48983333333333334,Negative

The application provides several formats of reports including PDF and Excel formats which makes it more convenient to use. It can send you weekly reports about test or you may generate the reports you need on demand.

Also I really appreciate the fact that, other than an average value of your glucose, this app gives you a standard deviation which basically it tells you if you are doing a good job or not trying to keep under control the average of your glucose level. In fact your HAb1c can be amazing but if this average is given by very high hyper and very low hypo, that means that your job is not really so good. Well, the standard deviation helps you to understand if you are really doing a good job. I'm not sure if I missing something or maybe it's just a feature of the paid version but I'd appreciate to distinguish which type of insulin I'm taking when I insert the amount.

3.51.0,3,"Traveled west  by 6 hours and and the app screwed up (superimposed) my data after the time change. There must be a better solution! Concretely: use UTC internally, get a continuous graph (without jump ing) in the app, and go into a new line in the report when turning the clock back, so you can keep the ""1 line = 1 day"" correspondence.  Another issue that could be improved:  Long acting insulin is not visible by default in the logbook, only when dragging an individual entry to the left. Maybe this is different on bigger screens (I have a 1920√ó1080 resolution), but in any case it is sub-optimal when one quickly wants to check whether one has entered the values already. There are several ways to solve this. For example, one could remove the column with the pictures, which are too small anyway to see anything. Or one could remove the vertical line with the dots, which serves no purpose at all. Or one could make everything a bit smaller.",0,0.05071022727272727,0.3221590909090909,Negative

One thing that would make it even better would be picking up My Fitness Pal carb data. That would make your app into a complete and effortless diabetes hub. I read the explanation on the web site, and it seems you are depending on Google Fit for all health data. Why not import My Fitness Pal's carb readings directly at, say, 11 PM every night. So many hub-apps have integrated My Fitness Pal into their apps. I'm sure they'd be pleased to allow access, since they do so with so many other apps. All you need are the carbs in grams. (Yes, I know it's lazy not to just log it, but diabetes self-care  is tiring, and this seems like a simple thing to add.) That said, thanks for the fix on the step counter and the lagginess.

So I was not only faced with learning to do insulin injections, but also how to prick his paw, analyze the results and get the results of the test back to the vet in a timely fashion. I bought an Accu Vue blood tester, a new piece of equipment for me and was surprised to learn, when I got it home, that it had data reporting and supported wireless transmissions.   Now I am a 63 year old woman with an outdated computer programming background from the 80's. So when you asked me my opinion of your software I was delighted to respond.  I Loved that Sugr was so Simple to set-up and easy to understand ...  as in the  ""keep it simple"" phrase drilled into my head by my programming instructor.  I know that I am not a luddite but still, I do find that fear and anxiety can be an obstacle to learning. So thank-you for keeping it easy and allowing me the opportunity to amaze my vet with my ability to email her my dog's blood glucose curve.

The program continues to improve and I use it with an Accu-Chek Guide meter which syncs through Bluetooth with the app.  It is easy to use and log carbs and insulin. Being able to see estimated A1C is  good encouragement to log extra times. I backed off 1/4 with my testing and my A1C went up at my Dr visit. I am now testing more often and will be back to normal or better due to this program. They do have support and have also helped me with any problems I've ever had.

It is useful to have different ratios/values for different times of day, but would be great to have custom values so we can set things like ""1hr gym"" or ""alcohol munchies"" etc., which would alter correction factors and/or insulin:carb ratios temporarily. The meter scanner should be available on Android! When searching through stats for a1c history or weight etc, it would be good if the search criteria were shown on the left so that the stats are in view (because currently any stats on the right side of results do not show unless each entry is swiped to the left to reveal them).

I am out time and money. After weeks of working with the mySugr design team we have finally gotten the mySugr app to sync with my meter. I am grateful for all the help they gave me.

3.36.1,4,New to diabetes  (recently diagnosed with LADA/Type 1.5) I find this app incredibly helpful to keep track of my blood sugar and meal information. The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that I've now subscribed to the Pro version but still don't seem to have access to the Bolus Calculator function despite living in the UK (as it's only available in the EU). It would be great to know how to access this going forward as I think this would be invaluable as my condition progresses further.,1,0.27954545454545454,0.6568181818181819,Positive

Quick to use if you are short on time,  or take your time and put in as much detail as you want. Only two recommendations I would wish for.  More meters supported.  I thought I used a very popular meter - one touch vivo.  But not supported.  Also cumbersome to enter your birthday.  I am 46, so I had to manually change the calendar month by month for 46 years.  What a pain!  Maybe a scroll bar to choose the year would be better?  Then go in and scroll to the proper month.  But overall those are not ongoing issues.  Just used for set up.  Out of all the programs I've ever used this one is by far the most comprehensive one and the easiest to use with choices for almost every set-up question.

I am currently having to set a separate timer outside of this app, which is a shame since your app had a great idea in place already. Otherwise, everything else about this app is wonderful!

The only thing I would really like to see is a food/nutrition database.  I am new to DB and do not yet have a handle on how many carbs everything is.  I use MyfitnessPal now to track food consumption.  It is perfect for inputting meals and spitting out how many carbs, sodium, fiber, protein I am getting per meal/day/week.  But; it cannot track heath issues like glucose.  So I am using both this app to track Sugar and MyFitnessPal to track food.   If MySugr could add a food database similar to how myfitnesspal does it; you would have a near perfect app!",1,0.33933566433566437,0.5657342657342658,Positive
